# Third-party notices

KORYAO Vector60 uses the following unmodified upstream packages through their public package
interfaces. No complete third-party repository is vendored into KORYAO.

## VTracer

- Upstream: `visioncortex/vtracer`
- License: MIT
- Version: `0.6.15`
- Release source: tag `0.6.15`, commit `fd9cdb08e622f237eb05be553a020ddc9e4c47a1`
- Purpose: generate initial color-vector candidates for the optional Artisan Vector60 pass.

## skia-pathops

- Upstream: `fonttools/skia-pathops`
- License: BSD-3-Clause
- Version: `0.9.2`
- Release source: annotated tag `v0.9.2`, peeled commit
  `c11e91f442462d1efc1a45d76c76ae9e74aa0de4`
- Purpose: bounded path union, intersection, difference, and xor operations after safety gates.

## svgpathtools

- Upstream: `mathandy/svgpathtools`
- License: MIT
- Version: `1.7.2`
- Release source: annotated tag `v1.7.2`, peeled commit
  `284fc2c591d852ef51b6168e8d842065f3e41cc2`
- Purpose: curve, tangent, curvature, intersection, and area analysis for geometry validation.

## SVGO

- Upstream: `svg/svgo`
- License: MIT
- Version: `4.0.2`
- Release source: annotated tag `v4.0.2`, peeled commit
  `b2309cf541aee11634eb653157b0ff86ab326e98`
- Purpose: final SVG cleanup and compression before KORYAO safety validation.

The release-source mappings above were verified against the upstream Git tag refs. The optional
Vector60 dependency group and the Windows PyInstaller sidecar build both pin VTracer,
skia-pathops, and svgpathtools. The sidecar performs an import and distribution-version check
against all three packages before staging.

SVGO is pinned in the root Node lockfile for source, CI, and build environments. The current
Windows one-folder sidecar and installer do **not** bundle Node.js or SVGO; installed desktop
runtime availability must not be inferred from the build-time lockfile.
diffvg and LIVE remain research references and are not production dependencies for this release
candidate.
