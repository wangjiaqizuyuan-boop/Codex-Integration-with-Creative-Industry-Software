# Changelog

## Unreleased / Optimizations

### 2026-07-23 — Author and license metadata correction

* Corrected the author and copyright name to 菅宝瑞 across project, desktop, plugin, registry, and documentation metadata.
* Changed current-version project metadata from MIT to `LicenseRef-KORYAO-Proprietary`, while preserving the license terms already distributed with earlier revisions.
* Added the KORYAO proprietary license notice, third-party rights boundary, and the statement that final interpretation of the KORYAO licensing terms belongs to 菅宝瑞 to the extent permitted by applicable law.

### 2026-07-23 — Pixel Reconstruction first customer route

* Promoted Pixel Reconstruction into the four-card processing-mode selector and made it the default customer route.
* Added an exact-only workflow that validates the source, reconstructs real raster-free SVG geometry, verifies the pixels, requests review, and delivers without forcing a second editable-vector pass.
* Kept Artisan, Smart, and Lightweight as optional dual-stage routes that retain the verified exact baseline before drawing an editable vector.
* Hardened Windows desktop sidecar startup with a preselected loopback port, split-ready-line decoding, and an authenticated bootstrap identity check.

### 2026-07-22 — Client loading-state correction

* Replaced the temporary “no projects” and “no deliverables” flashes with explicit local loading states while project, delivery, and Adobe export history records are still being read.
* Kept read failures distinct from genuinely empty customer data so a slow or unavailable local bridge is not presented as data loss.
* Added desktop regression coverage for delayed project and delivery responses.

### 2026-07-22 — KORYAO 0.1.0-alpha.2 integrated Windows preview

* Exposed the existing exact RGBA-to-SVG engine as the customer-facing Pixel Vector mode while retaining the stable internal `exact` identifier and previous task compatibility.
* Integrated the visible Codex conversation workspace, bounded 64/128/256 MB SVG controls, and explicit native PSD/AI save-path delivery from the merged Windows validation line.
* Verified a 768×1024 customer Pixel Vector job with zero differing pixels, then generated and natively reopened both Illustrator AI and Photoshop PSD outputs through the desktop save-path flow.
* Clarified that a newly installed Codex MCP connector requires fully restarting Codex before pairing in a new task.
* Preserved local application data and source files; alpha.2 remains an unsigned internal preview pending clean-machine installer and signing validation.

### 2026-07-22 — DiagramForge and Photoshop typed production plans

* Added the independent DiagramForge structured-drawing board, Codex Skill, typed MCP tools, native Draw.io compiler, editable SVG preview, stable-ID patch transactions, quality validation, resumable batch plans, and desktop navigation.
* Added Photoshop capability discovery, progressive tool profiles, typed Recipe DSL compilation, deterministic batch planning, and copy-first delivery verification without expanding arbitrary BatchPlay or path access.
* Fixed the Photoshop Node Proxy so each confirmed UXP operation is forwarded exactly once.
* Added pinned upstream and license research, integration tests, truth-state documentation, and guarded package commands for both modules.

### 2026-07-18 — KORYAO 0.1.0-alpha.1 Windows app

* Replaced the legacy desktop UI with the editorial StarBridge control-console design while retaining existing local workflows and software probes.
* Added an in-place Codex connector migration that backs up `config.toml`, replaces only the legacy `starbridge-desktop` tables, and preserves every unrelated Codex and MCP setting.
* Added migration, backup-failure, idempotency, desktop frontend, packaged sidecar, and Windows installer regression coverage.

* Added Artisan final-render adaptive optimization with high-fidelity, balanced, and minimal-anchor quality presets.
* Added original-resolution SVG rendering, structural difference, normalized MAE, edge Dice, local error hotspots, Pareto selection, reverse anchor deletion, and deterministic rollback to the prior Artisan result.
* Added quality-gated four-anchor cubic ellipse fitting while preserving four-corner rectangles and compound-path holes.
* Added local SHA-256 keyed candidate caching, bounded memory policies, compact quality/edit/patch references, and safe pre-publish resource-limit stops.
* Preserved Exact, Smart, and Lightweight execution and output behavior; Illustrator remains outside candidate generation and validation.

### 2026-07-16 — Artisan Vector iteration 5

* Added deterministic geometric-intent profiles for flow contours, ornaments, details, and micro details, with profile-specific simplification and Bézier smoothing.
* Added coverage-aware micro-stroke cleanup and a fourth independent quality gate; failed candidates retain iteration-4 continuation, iteration-3 centerlines, or iteration-2 outline fills.
* Added a vector-sampled Artisan preview plus schema-v3 intent metadata and stable `intent:*` selectors without claiming content recognition.
* Added a 6,133-byte `artisan_edit_index.json` and local selector inspector so agents can request one edit scope without loading the 23,839-byte previous structure context.
* Validated the retained authorized local preview without committing assets: 30,813 to 24,875 centerline anchors (19.27% fewer), 10,309 to 8,064 subpaths (21.78% fewer), 116 to 110 edit batches (5.17% fewer), and 1,014,783 to 861,890 SVG bytes (15.07% fewer), while retaining 93.13% recall and 74.54% Dice.

### 2026-07-16 — Artisan Vector iteration 4

* Added deterministic tangent- and width-aware continuation through skeleton junctions so visually continuous lines become longer editable paths instead of many isolated segments.
* Added an independent continuation quality gate for subpaths, anchors, edit batches, precision, recall, and Dice, with automatic fallback to iteration-3 centerlines and then iteration-2 outline fills.
* Added before/after continuation metrics and compact CLI evidence for path, anchor, edit-batch, and mean editable-stroke-length improvements.
* Validated the retained authorized local pattern preview without committing any asset: 16,239 to 10,309 subpaths (36.52% fewer), 40,972 to 30,813 centerline anchors (24.79% fewer), 174 to 116 edit batches (33.33% fewer), and 57.48% longer mean paths.
* Reduced the real local structure index from 39,756 to 23,839 bytes while retaining 94.04% recall, 74.71% Dice, no raster, no external references, and zero external AI calls.

### 2026-07-16 — Artisan Vector iteration 3

* Added deterministic local centerline extraction for thin line art, producing editable open cubic strokes with round caps, round joins, and bounded variable widths.
* Added quality-gated selection against the existing outline-fill result; insufficient anchor reduction, precision, recall, Dice similarity, or complexity automatically retains the previous safe output.
* Extended the fail-closed SVG verifier with a separate open-stroke contract while preserving the original closed-fill contract.
* Added compact stroke-batch edit references so follow-up changes can target a stable local object without repeating the image context.
* Added a `--compact` CLI response and minified edit manifest; the local sample structure index dropped from 88,720 to 39,756 bytes while the full report remains on disk.
* Validated the authorized local traditional-pattern sample without committing source or outputs: 45,029 anchors, 22.44% fewer than the iteration-2 outline fill and 38.39% fewer than the 73,086-anchor baseline, with 94.25% recall, 75.00% Dice, and zero external AI calls.

### 2026-07-16 — Artisan Vector iteration 2

* Added deterministic design layers, stable shape ids, parent/depth metadata, and a compact structure reference for low-token follow-up edits.
* Added local line-art detection that separates paper texture from ink, removes redundant background geometry, and bounds knockout paths to 96 subpaths per editable object.
* Added contour-distance, single-shape area, and compound-area quality gates with local high-fidelity fallback for thin artwork.
* Added safe grouped SVG verification for layer order, roles, ids, parent references, and structure depth.
* Validated an authorized local traditional-pattern line drawing without committing the source or generated artifacts: 58,057 anchors versus a 73,086-anchor baseline (20.56% fewer), 1.25 px maximum contour error, and zero external AI calls.

### 2026-07-16 — Artisan Vector iteration 1

* Added a premium `artisan` mode without replacing Smart, Lightweight, Exact, or legacy entry points.
* Added protected-corner anchor classification and mixed absolute `M/L/C/Z` paths with cubic Bézier control handles.
* Added adaptive contour fitting that restores anchors when the measured contour error exceeds the quality tolerance.
* Added separate anchor, control-point, curve-segment, line-segment, anchor-reduction, and contour-error evidence to the verifier and reports.
* Added Artisan mode to the CLI and PySide6 desktop mode cards, with an offscreen end-to-end test.

### 2026-07-16 — Three-mode vector engine and desktop prototype

* Added one verified vectorization core with Smart Vector as the default, Lightweight Vector for low-complexity editing, and Exact Reconstruction for RGBA pixel proof.
* Added deterministic local SVG/PNG/report outputs, path/point/file-size limits, vertically merged exact rectangles, and exact pixel validation.
* Added a PySide6 desktop prototype with image drag-and-drop, three mode cards, parameter controls, background conversion, side-by-side previews, result metrics, and local output-folder access.
* Preserved the previous exact and legacy quantized commands as compatibility entry points; Illustrator remains an optional explicit desktop handoff.

### 2026-07-15 — Exact pixel-vector reconstruction becomes primary

* Added `exact_pixel_vector.py`, which rebuilds one explicit PNG/JPEG RGBA grid as grouped rectangle compound paths, verifies a raster-free SVG, and hands it to Illustrator for Save As AI without Image Trace.
* Switched `illustrator:vectorize:offline` to the exact route. The previous OpenCV quantized workflow remains available as `illustrator:vectorize:legacy-quantized` for compatibility and research.
* Added deterministic RGBA, transparency, privacy, sandbox, complexity-limit, package-command, and SVG verifier coverage.
* Repositioned README and Chinese Illustrator documentation around exact image-to-AI delivery while retaining Adobe protocols, ComfyUI, CAD/AutoCAD, Blender, CapCut/Jianying, MCP stdio, UXP, and local proxy capabilities.
* Documented a sanitized local write with 742,922 rectangle subpaths and a successfully saved desktop AI; no source image, local path, SVG, AI, or report is committed.

### 2026-06-27 — MCP Prompts (complete the 3 primitives)

* **MCP Prompts capability (new).** Added the third MCP primitive alongside tools
  and resources. The stdio server now serves `prompts/list` and `prompts/get`,
  declares the `prompts` capability in `initialize`, and exposes five reusable,
  parameterized safe-by-default prompt templates: `bridge_status_check`,
  `comfyui_safe_workflow`, `cad_dxf_from_spec`, `photoshop_recipe_run`, and
  `safe_write_protocol`. Each template bakes in the validate-first / dry-run /
  explicit-confirmation / sandbox-only protocol. Implemented in
  `starbridge_mcp/core/prompts.py`, covered by `tests/test_mcp_prompts.py`.
* KORYAO now exposes the full MCP surface: Tools (what the client can do),
  Resources (what the client should know), and Prompts (how to do it safely).

### 2026-06-27 — MCP Resources, regression fix, lint gate

* **MCP Resources capability (new).** Following the comparable-project pattern
  "resources describe what the client should know, tools describe what the client
  can do", the stdio server now exposes read-only, sanitized resources via
  `resources/list` and `resources/read`: `starbridge://safety-policy`,
  `starbridge://capabilities`, `starbridge://safe-roots`, and
  `starbridge://bridges`. Implemented in `starbridge_mcp/core/resources.py`.
* `initialize` now declares the `resources` capability and returns an
  `instructions` field that teaches clients the safe-by-default protocol
  (dry-run defaults, confirmation flags, sandbox output boundaries) before any
  tool call. Covered by `tests/test_mcp_resources.py`.
* **Regression fix:** removed a duplicated block in `starbridge_mcp/mcp_server.py`
  that defined `_recipe_output_dir` and the five `photoshop.recipe_*` handlers a
  second time, silently overriding the richer recipe implementations (the
  "fleshed out 5 core recipes" work) with stub versions. The detailed recipe
  plans, steps, tool mappings, and quality gates are now actually served.
* Removed a duplicate `from starbridge_mcp.bridges import autocad_dxf` import.
* **Lint gate:** added a dedicated `lint` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  running `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`, and brought the whole repo to a
  clean ruff state (import sorting, an unused import, a `SIM103` simplification,
  and format drift across tests). Previously ruff was only wired into
  `pre-commit`, not CI, despite the note below.

### Repo & Packaging
* Added root `LICENSE` (MIT) to match pyproject declaration.
* Added `.github/FUNDING.yml` for sponsorship visibility.
* Enhanced `pyproject.toml`: added classifiers, project.urls (GitHub repo, issues, docs), expanded description and keywords for better discoverability.
* Improved CI workflow: added Windows runner (project is Windows-first), pip/npm caching, modern actions, broader Python matrix.
* Centralized `BRIDGE_PROFILES`, `BRIDGE_NAME_MAP`, `BRIDGE_ALIASES` in `core/tool_registry.py` as single source of truth (previously duplicated in server.py). Updated imports and test. This eliminates metadata duplication while keeping compat.
* Added long-term code quality tooling: ruff (lint + formatter) to dev dependencies and pyproject.toml config. Integrated into CI (both ubuntu and windows jobs) with `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`. Auto-fixed 100+ issues (imports, formatting, outdated guards, etc.). Added npm scripts for lint/format. Removed outdated Python version checks. All checks now enforced for sustainable quality.

### Documentation & Structure
* Polished README: added prominent Getting Started / Quick Install section, License badges and section, better onboarding.
* Central tool capability metadata in `core/tool_registry.py` and bridge profiles in `server.py` — added cross-reference notes to reduce drift.

### Photoshop Enhancements (C + Recipes follow-up)
* Added `ps.get_preview` (base64/path for vision models) and `ps.get_state` (lightweight snapshot) — read-only, cheap, safe for iterative agent use.
* Fleshed out 5 core recipes with concrete steps/tools: remove_background, enhance_portrait, frequency_separation, color_grade, prepare_for_web. Recipes return plans with safety gates.
* Enhanced Action Plan mode in recipe_plan (action_plan=true) for plan-then-execute with repair hints.
* Updated schemas, tools, bridge adapter, mcp handlers, tool_registry, and docs for new preview/state + recipes.
* More recipe details: steps now map to existing ps.* tools (selection, layers, batchplay, preview, evidence).

### Release Process
* Improved install-and-publish.md with clearer PyPI/npm/MCP registry paths, smoke test commands, and productization checklist.
* Added .github/workflows/release.yml for automated GitHub releases on v* tags (with build artifacts, notes).
* Enhanced get_preview to leverage preview_export for better plans; get_state now includes more dynamic info from probes/layers.
* More recipe details: concrete step-by-step for remove_background and enhance_portrait with tool mappings, execution notes, and safety.
* Updated CHANGELOG with unreleased long-term optimizations.
* Added pre-commit config (ruff, mypy) and CI enforcement for consistent releases.
* VERSION and pyproject kept in sync; recommend `scripts/starbridge_preflight.py` + security check before publish.
