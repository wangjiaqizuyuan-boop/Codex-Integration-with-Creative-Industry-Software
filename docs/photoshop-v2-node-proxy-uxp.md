# Photoshop v2 Node Proxy + UXP Bridge

This document describes the v2 Photoshop control path for KORYAO.

```text
Codex / MCP client
  -> KORYAO MCP tools
  -> local Node Proxy
  -> Photoshop UXP plugin
  -> Photoshop DOM / typed batchPlay / executeAsModal
```

The v2 path is still experimental. It is designed to make Photoshop control observable and guarded, not to run arbitrary scripts against private PSD files.

At the repository level, this UXP path serves the KORYAO skill and MCP layers: Codex should enter it through `starbridge-photoshop-mcp`, discover guarded tools through KORYAO MCP, and use the Node Proxy only as the local transport to typed Photoshop UXP handlers.

## What v2 Adds

| Area | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| Node Proxy | Local HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint, UXP WebSocket endpoint, `/health`, `/bridge/status`, `/events` |
| UXP plugin | Registers Photoshop host info, reconnects after proxy restarts, exposes typed handlers |
| Read-only tools | `ps.probe`, `ps.document.info`, `ps.layers.list` |
| Guarded write path | `ps.preview.export`, `ps.batchplay.execute_confirmed` behind confirmation and sandbox policy |
| Evidence | Returns `EvidenceManifest` fields for bridge kind, UXP status, host info, layer snapshot, validation result |

## Start the Node Proxy

```powershell
npm.cmd run photoshop:node-proxy
```

Default local endpoints:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8971/health
http://127.0.0.1:8971/bridge/status
http://127.0.0.1:8971/events
ws://127.0.0.1:8971/uxp
```

Use `STARBRIDGE_PHOTOSHOP_PROXY_PORT` if you need another local port.

## Load the UXP Plugin

Open Adobe UXP Developer Tool and load:

```text
uxp/photoshop-bridge
```

Then start the plugin in Photoshop. On connect, the plugin registers with the Node Proxy and sends basic host metadata:

- app name
- Photoshop version
- connection timestamp

If the Node Proxy restarts, the UXP client attempts to reconnect automatically.

## Run the MCP Server

```powershell
python -m starbridge_mcp.mcp_server
```

Then call:

- `ps.probe`
- `ps.document.info`
- `ps.layers.list`
- `ps.batchplay.validate`

`ps.probe` should show:

- `node_proxy_running`
- `uxp_client_connected`
- `photoshop_host_seen`
- `photoshop_host`
- COM fallback state

## Safe BatchPlay Contract

All write-like actions must pass through the typed allowlist and explicit confirmation.

Allowed descriptor families are intentionally narrow:

- `get`
- `duplicate`
- `make`
- `set`
- `move`

Denied descriptor families include destructive or arbitrary execution paths:

- `delete`
- merge / flatten / rasterize
- arbitrary JavaScript
- raw nested `batchPlay`
- overwrite-style saves

Confirmed execution requires:

- `requires_confirmation=true`
- `confirm_write=true`
- sandbox output only
- a prior `ps.batchplay.validate` result with no blocked descriptors

## Local Smoke Checks

These checks do not require Photoshop to be installed:

```powershell
python -m unittest tests.test_photoshop_node_proxy
python -m unittest tests.test_photoshop_adapter_v1
```

With local Photoshop and the UXP plugin running:

```powershell
npm.cmd run photoshop:node-proxy
python -m starbridge_mcp.mcp_server
```

Then call `ps.probe` from an MCP client and confirm the bridge reports `node_proxy_uxp`.

## Current Limits

- UXP preview export is routed but bitmap encoding still depends on local Photoshop host support.
- The bridge does not open private PSD files by itself.
- Arbitrary script execution remains disabled.
- Real outputs must stay in sandbox or ignored output directories.
- Account, Creative Cloud, licensed asset, and private project data must not be committed.
