# KORYAO Photoshop MCP

## Core Rule

Treat Photoshop as a local authorized desktop app with private user assets. Prefer KORYAO read-only probes, document summaries, recipe plans, and validation before any GUI action or export.

Do not open private PSD files, scan source-image folders, run arbitrary JSX/BatchPlay, save/export real artwork, read Creative Cloud cache, or write outside approved sandbox output.

## Read First

Read only what is needed:

- `examples/photoshop_bridge/README.md`
- `docs/03-codex-photoshop.md`
- `docs/photoshop-codex-bridge.md`
- `docs/diagramforge-photoshop-upstream-audit.md` when comparing upstream capabilities
- `.codex/skills/starbridge-smart-cutout-ps/SKILL.md` for one-subject-per-layer tasks
- `starbridge_mcp/adapters/photoshop/`
- `starbridge_mcp/core/tool_registry.py`
- `tests/test_photoshop_*.py`
- `docs/adobe-mcp-github-research.md` only when comparing outside projects

If changing shared MCP behavior, also read `.codex/skills/starbridge-mcp/SKILL.md`.

## Safe Commands

```powershell
npm.cmd run photoshop:diagnose
npm.cmd run photoshop:info
python -m starbridge_mcp.server tools --json --safe-only
python examples\bridge_status.py --json --redact-paths --soft-exit
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts\security_check.py
```

Use `npm.cmd`, not bare `npm`, on Windows PowerShell.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred tool path | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check availability | `ps.probe`, `photoshop.session_info` | Read-only, no PSD open |
| Discover typed maturity | `ps.capabilities` | Static support is separate from live connection truth |
| Compile a result Recipe | `ps.recipe.compile` | Real production recipes name `workflow:photoshop-production-v1`; planned categories are blocked |
| Build a resumable batch | `ps.batch.plan` | Deterministic single-host FIFO; planned items never enter the executable queue |
| Verify delivery gates | `ps.result.verify` | Sanitized before/after state, artifact hashes, native reopen when PSD is requested |
| Read live state/preview | `ps.get_state`, `ps.get_preview` | Fail closed; mock state and placeholder previews are never accepted as evidence |
| Inspect active document | `ps.document.info`, `photoshop.document_info` | Active document only, no save/export |
| Inspect layers | `ps.layers.list` | Layer tree summary only |
| Separate each visible subject | `$starbridge-smart-cutout-ps` | Explicit image/spec/model; generated files stay in ignored output |
| Validate BatchPlay | `ps.batchplay.validate` | Validate descriptors, never execute arbitrary BatchPlay |
| Plan actions | `photoshop.recipe_list`, `photoshop.recipe_plan` | Dry-run first |
| Prepare Illustrator trace source | `photoshop.recipe_run` + `prepare_vector_trace` | One authorized PNG/JPEG; copy first; write/export confirmations |
| Validate recipe | `photoshop.recipe_validate` | Check manifest and sandbox paths |
| Debug recipe | `photoshop.recipe_debug` | Return guidance only |

## Write Rules

Any real Photoshop write/export must require:

- `confirm_write=true` or `confirm_export=true`
- sandbox output under ignored output directories
- sanitized JSON result
- declared expected output files
- EvidenceManifest entry
- no absolute user path in returned text

Never add a raw "execute script" tool. Add audited recipe-level actions instead.

## Smart Cutout Routing

Route requests such as “每栋楼一个图层”, “每个物体分别抠图”, or “生成可编辑分层 PSD” to `$starbridge-smart-cutout-ps`. That skill owns instance prompt boxes, disjoint full-canvas RGBA export, preview review, and the Photoshop-native save/reopen compatibility gate.

Do not claim completion from masks or a parser-readable PSD alone. Require the expected subject count, exact pixel partition, and `validated_after_reopen=true`; otherwise report the result as needing review or prepared for Photoshop.

For `prepare_vector_trace`, keep the fixed flow: validate authorization → copy the explicit source into `examples/output/photoshop` → run only the repository JSX → save a redacted EvidenceManifest → pass only the prepared sandbox PNG to Illustrator.

## Validation

After Photoshop MCP changes, run:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts\starbridge_preflight.py --markdown
python scripts\security_check.py
python -m starbridge_mcp.server tools --json --safe-only
npm.cmd test
```

Report local Photoshop as unavailable if it is not installed, not licensed, not open, or not reachable through COM/UXP. Do not turn that into pass.
