# KORYAO Canvas MCP

## Core Rule

Treat the canvas as a local visual workspace, not as a public asset store. Canvas state, page assets, generated images, annotation screenshots, and project-specific boards stay in the user-selected local `canvas/` directory and should not be committed.

## Read First

Read only the files relevant to the canvas task:

- `docs/starbridge-canvas.md`
- `examples/starbridge_canvas/README.md`
- `examples/starbridge_canvas/src/App.jsx`
- `examples/starbridge_canvas/vite.config.js`
- `examples/starbridge_canvas/mcp/server.mjs`
- `scripts/start_starbridge_canvas.ps1`

## Quick Commands

Start the realtime canvas:

```powershell
npm.cmd run canvas:dev -- -ProjectDir "<project-dir>"
```

Start the canvas MCP server:

```powershell
npm.cmd run canvas:mcp
```

Build-check the canvas:

```powershell
npm.cmd run canvas:build
```

## MCP Client Config

Use this stdio command for local MCP clients that need direct canvas tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "starbridge-canvas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["examples/starbridge_canvas/mcp/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

Set `STARBRIDGE_CANVAS_URL` if the canvas runs on a non-default port. Legacy `COWART_URL` is accepted only as a migration alias.

## Tool Routing

Use `get_starbridge_canvas_selection` before acting on a selected shape. Use `insert_starbridge_canvas_image` only with an explicit local image path supplied by the current workflow. Prefer inserting new results beside a selected source image or annotation, not overwriting existing canvas content.

Realtime sync uses `/api/canvas-events` and `/api/canvas-live`. If the UI shows reconnecting, verify the local canvas dev server is running before retrying MCP image insertion.

## Safety

Never scan the user's home directory for canvas assets. Never commit `canvas/`, `node_modules/`, build output, generated screenshots, inserted images, or local page assets. Do not print absolute user paths in public docs or PR descriptions unless they are intentionally redacted examples.
