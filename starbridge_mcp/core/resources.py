"""KORYAO MCP read-only resources.

Following the MCP convention "resources describe what the client should know,
tools describe what the client can do", this module exposes static, sanitized
context (capability matrix, safe roots, bridge profiles, and the safety policy)
as MCP resources. Every resource is read-only, application-controlled, network
free, and free of private paths.

KORYAO is local-first and safe-by-default. Read this before calling any tool
that writes or launches local software.

## Default posture
- Read-only probe / validate / plan tools are safe to call directly.
- Any tool that writes, exports, or runs local software defaults to
  `dry_run=true` and performs no real I/O until confirmed.

## Confirming real actions
- Real local actions require an explicit confirmation flag matching the tool:
  `confirm_write=true`, `confirm_export=true`, or `confirm_run=true`.
- Without the matching confirmation, guarded tools return `ok=false` and refuse.

## Output boundaries
- Writes must stay inside declared sandbox / ignored output roots. See the
  `starbridge://safe-roots` resource for the exact list.
- Never open or export private PSD / AI / DWG / .blend / draft / model / customer
  asset paths through public tools.

## Discovery
- Call `starbridge.tools` to enumerate capabilities with risk levels.
- Call `starbridge.recipe_evidence` to preview recipe quality gates and asset
  manifest entries before any confirmed write.
- Read `starbridge://capabilities` and `starbridge://bridges` for static context.
- Call `starbridge.status` or `*.environment_probe` for live readiness.

## Out of scope by design
- No automatic login, account creation, password / OTP / token entry.
- No payments, subscriptions, or purchases.
- No uploading customer assets or private projects.
- No bypassing captchas, paywalls, licensing, or security checks.
